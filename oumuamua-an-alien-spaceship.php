                                    <p> As per theory, many objects pass through our solar system which don't belong to our solar system. But these objects go unnoticed because we don't have the best telescopes.

                                        <p>Oumuamua (pronounced as moo-aa-moo-aa) which is the first interstellar object observed, meaning, it is not revolving around our Sun, but it has a trajectory which originates and terminates outside of our solar system.
                                    
                                            <p>Comets are asteroids which have an ice layer on them. When they go near the sun or accelerate very fast in some atmosphere, ice evaporates and becomes vapor which gives it an appearance of the tail. At first the astronomers thought that Oumuamua was a comet. A comet without a tail? This is not common.

                                                <p>Also, a paper by Shmuel Bialy and Abraham Loeb at Harvard Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics says that Oumuamua might be using solar sail to accelerate this fast. Basically, solar sail is a method in which light reflection is used to provide some thrust to the object. For example, if we direct light on a mirror, the light reflects back but pushes the mirror forward. This is a wrong analogy but this is the basic idea of solar sailing. We have been using solar sailing since 2010.

                                                    <p>Let's assume it is an alien spaceship, do we need to worry?
        The answer is, most likely No. Letâ€™s take 3 cases of civilization/evolution comparing aliens and humans.
        <ol>

            <li><b>Aliens > Humans</b><br>
            If aliens are more evolved than humans, then we are like a small isolated ant colony to them. And it is very rare for humans to interfere with such ant colonies. So an alien invasion is very unlikely to happen because we don't have anything important for them. They might be waiting for our civilization to evolve so later we can be a little more useful to them.
            <li><b>Aliens = Humans</b><br>
            If you are aware of the Kardashev scale, we are not even close to Type I civilization. We are not yet evolved enough to study or even discover new alien species. So if aliens are like us, they might also not be evolved enough to discover us. So we are safe.
            <li><b>Aliens < Humans</b><br>
            In this case, the only way both can interact is we discover them (which may not happen, discussed in case 2), because aliens in this case may be like our early stage ancestors, who are having a difficult time to survive on their planet, how will they discover us?

            </ol>
        <p>We have sent many objects outside of our solar system. So there's a possibility that Oumuamua might be a top-tech debris from some other civilization. Which can happen in case 1 and 2.
        Oumuamua can also be a natural object. A highly unusual natural object. We were not able to study this object thoroughly due to limitations of our telescopes and time. So I don't think it's correct to jump to any conclusions right now. But we should not stop our research on discovering space and alien life because they have answers to the questions we have not asked yet.
