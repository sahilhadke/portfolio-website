                                    Benefits of meditation put into simple words. Hence, its very easy to understand.
This book forces you to think about every chapter and how is it applicable in your life.
This book has a reference to a lot of self help books, so you can say that its a compressed copy of some 50 books.
Though this book explains meditation from Zen (Buddhism) perspective, every other religion has a similar concept. 
This book does not promote Buddhism.

                                <h4>My Top 3 Quotes from this book</h4>
                                <ol>
                                    <li>
                                        <i>Take action! Don't think about it - do it. You'll be amazed how much better it feels to take action.</i><br>
This quote reminds me of the 2 minute rule - If you don't feel like doing something which you have to do (say reading a book) just do it right away for 2 minutes only (with a timer) and you may stop the work after that. Taking the first step is the hardest!
                                    </li>

                                <li><i>The more we care for the happiness of others, the greater is our own sense of well-being. Cultivating a close, warm-hearted feeling for others automatically puts the mind at ease. It helps remove whatever fears or insecurities we may have and gives us the strength to cope with any obstacles we encounter. It is the principal source of success in life.</i><br>
                                - Dalai Lama

                                </li>
<li><i>Success is a journey, not a destination. The doing is often more important than the outcome.<br>
- Arthur Ashe (late American tennis player).</li>
